## My notes
- Opened quarto (cmd+shit+p and search for quarto)
- Table of content just for me (cmd+shit+p and search for outline)
- Insert code chunk (cmd+shit+p and search for chunk, "Insert a new chunk code")
- run line (ctrl + enter)
- Zenodo is also a place with free datasets

## Setup code chunk
"setup" is the label and "setup" is special because it is decoted that this chunk should be run first
```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
# option + minus = <-
# read_csv2 means to read semicolon seperated files like the python ,sep=;

data_post_meal <- read_csv2(here::here("data/post-meal-insulin.csv"))


```


## Showing the data
```{r}
data_post_meal
```

```{r}
glimpse(data_post_meal)
```
